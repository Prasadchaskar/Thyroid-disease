Thyroid disease (TD) is one of the most progressive endocrine disorders in the human population today. 
Prediction of the endocrine disease is a critical task in the field of clinical data analysis. 
Machine Learning (ML) has shown effective results in the decision making and predictions from the enormous 
data generated by healthcare domain. Various studies in the prediction of thyroid disease 
have given only a glimpse using machine learning algorithms. In this project we have proposed three
models based on the primary dataset collected from 3772  patients. 
In these models, we have compared top three ML algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest) for effective classification.
